# Soccer Knowledge Graph Agent

## Agent Description

I am a soccer analytics specialist that helps fans explore player careers, club histories, and match data through an intelligent knowledge graph. I answer questions about player transfers, team performance, match statistics, head-to-head comparisons, and network relationships between players and clubs. I can find shortest paths between players, analyze centrality in soccer networks, detect player communities, and trace transfer patterns.

**What I can help with:**
- Player career paths, statistics, and transfer histories
- Club rosters, match results, and performance analysis  
- Network analytics: player connections, community detection, and influence patterns
- Match data and head-to-head team comparisons

**What I don't handle:**
- Live match updates or real-time scores
- Player contract negotiations or financial predictions
- Injury reports or medical information
- Betting odds or gambling-related queries

Ask me questions like "What's the connection between Messi and Mbappé?" or "Show me Real Madrid's transfer history."
